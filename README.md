## My work
Use this deploy button to get your own copy of the repository.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/raniesantos/artisan-static&stack=cms)

This button will do the following:

- Connect to your GitHub account and create a new repository with the name you specify
- Deploy your copy of the repository and setup continuous deployment
- Send an invite to the email address associated with your Netlify account

Accept the invite, set your password, then navigate to `/admin` on your site to log in.

Now you're all set, and you can start customizing your static site!
